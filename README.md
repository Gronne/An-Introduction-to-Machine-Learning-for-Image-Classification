# An Introduction to Machine Learning for Image classification
This repository is the code for the article "An Introduction to Machine Learning for Image Classification". The article is written by Mathias GrÃ¸nne at Aarhus University Department of Engineering for the course "Optimization and Data Analytics" at the fall semester of 2020.

## Setup
Download the repository -> Run Main.py.

Personal data can be used. Just use the DataLoaders.py file in the "DataManipulation" folder to load your own data instead. Use load_mnist() function as an example of how to load the data. The data does not need to images, the implementation has been made general to work with N-dimensions.
